            <h2>Section one : Conserve Water</h2>
            <p>
                Earth is the only known planet in this universe where life is possible only because of the availability of water and oxygen. Water is most important necessity of life for all the living beings on the earth. Without water no one can exist even for a day. We also know that there is very less percentage of clean water means drinking water available on the earth. So, we should not waste clean water and save it for future generations. 

We should change our bad habits into positive ones and spread awareness among people about the importance of clean water. We should promote the less use and saving of clean water to maintain the continuity of life on the earth.

            <h2>Section two : Reeduce Plastic</h2>
            <p>
                Plastic is one of the main materials found in landfills and can take up to a thousand years to biodegrade, leading to a more polluted and toxic environment. Even when properly recycled, the amount of energy and fossil fuels to create plastic is unsustainable and harmful to our planet.
There are, of course, many other reasons why we should reduce the use of plastic in our everyday lives, but these are the main reasons. But that doesnâ€™t mean thereâ€™s not more to learn, and the more we learn about this issue, the better chance our planet has to survive.

            <h2>Section three : Planting Trees</h2>
            <p>
                A mature tree can absorb up to 21 kilograms of carbon dioxide per year. trees can already absorb the entire amount of CO2 produced by one person. and how cool is that? ðŸ¤¯ With every planted tree, you reduce the CO2 levels in the atmosphere, purifying the air you breathe
If youâ€™re curious, find out what is your current carbon footprint ! Trees, especially in forests, harbor many species of wildlife. When you plant trees, you support biodiversity by expanding the natural habitat of many endangered animal species. You can keep your assets in your bunq account - but squirrels need trees for that
Being mindful of your everyday choices is a great start - and by planting trees, you get to really speed things up!
